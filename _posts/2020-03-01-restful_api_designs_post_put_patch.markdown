Honestly, I have been struggling to remember the difference when using post, put, or patch. I thought since I couldn't be the only one having a hard time that I would write a little something on a review.

* POST: is a method for new resources being created
* PATCH: is for a resource being updated
* PUT: is for when a resource is being replace entirely. You would not want to use this unless the objective is to completly replace the object or else you could lose data.
