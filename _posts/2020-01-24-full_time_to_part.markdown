I wanted to update my blog with the changes going on in my education. I recently made the decision to switch to part-time from the full time corse. This was not a easy decision but I do believe I made the correct choice.

See when I started all of this I made two really good friends. Taishawn and Henry. Since I started in october we have all been working together. Taishawn and I were in the same full time, while when I met Henry he was in the self pace. Taishawn and I had been struggling to balance life and school. We had talked about switching to part time after weeks of us both barely making deadline. No kidding both staying up together and coding all day everyday. However, when Taishawn made the leap to part-time, I decided to ride it out to see what I could do. 

Honestly, every week was cramming it felt like. It fel like I was working to do instead of working ro know. When it came to the first project, I was super suprised to realize I knew a lot more than I thought. I had a blast doing the project and loved the challenge. However, I did not get to do everything I wanted, the project was late due to errors on my part (I accidentally deleted it in a rookie mistake kind of situation) and I started to fall behind. 

Aroudn this time I started talking to what I have been calling the "coding fam." See we did not know that we all knew each other and were all working together till about a month ago. When we did we started a group chat. Since we are all parents and new too coding, we really wwatch out for each other. After talking to the guys about how their experince was going I thought it would be best to change over. Life had been throwing me curve balls left and right and... I just got so confused and behind. The work was done but I was doing to do. I was not understanding. So after a talk with my lead I went ahead and made the switch.

This gave me like a week and a half of down time. I was able to start to go slowly on the work that confused me. I just saw the schedule and no kidding, it is amazing. The thing is when you liek something and you turn it into a stress instead of a pleasure, you lose on the experince. I was no longer enjoying coding like I was. It became more of a chore than a eye opening, and life changing educational adventure. I am glad to be getting back to the books at a pace that will allow me to soak it in and enjoy the ride. 

So here is to starting fresh! I can't wait to see how the experince is now that I will be able to fit all aspects of my life into this world perfectly!
