Coding is a collaborating art form. The further I get into my boot camps curriculum I realize this. I am noticing more and more how the bigger picture comes together.

Take for example the beginning of this journey. We were taught to build methods and how to use them. For a while I thought this was it. That I had to master this and then there would be some nice touches here and there to add. However, then I hit classes and it felt like my world was turned upside down. Just going to be honest and say that it did not “click” for me at first. Actually even that is an understatement. It did not click at all. I was so worried about it that I believe that caused it not to click but once it did I was sailing. Then we got to active record… and I realized that what I had been doing was essentially the long way. That active record would.could do a good deal of what I had been learning. As well as that active record… WAS CREATED BY SOMEONE with the foresight and thought to make the coding world a little easier.

The “practice makes perfect” phrase is not a lie but not a full truth either. The more you do something the more you start to understand how it works. Each time I thought I understood something, later it became a bit clearer. There is no such thing as a perfect coder. I have learned this and seen it over time. Not just from my experience but from my friend who have been helping me. 

I am fortunate enough to have friends who are in the software engineering field. Now, don't laugh but… I at first thought if I had to google things that I was not a good coder. I knew we had to google for some but my understanding was that it was like a few things here and there. When I discussed this with my friend I realized how wrong I was. That it is going to be a big part of being a coder. It is a lot of information that is not humanly possible for someone to memorize or know all of. As well as there are many languages and all coders have a preference. I realized that it also means going out of your comfort zone more than not. This also means… interaction with other coders.

My friend let me video chat with him while he worked one day. I was amazed at how it was basically the same as now but on a different level. He was working on developing an app for the ios market. I got to see him as he reached out for help because he had not done an app for ios before. Here I was thinking I was some horrible coder… and my friend who has been doing it for years, helping me without breaking a sweat when I am struggling, and who I might have put on an unrealistic pedestal… was reaching out for help. This is when I had my realization….

Coding is about community. One google search for an answer and you will see this. There are forms just for helping each other. There are codes people make to help make things easier and they then share them. As much as the world like to say that technology is making human interactions less frequent… in our case this is not true.  We are a community. Each with our own preference and talents. Each with a better grasp on one thing than another. We are all wired differently but we come together to make beautiful works of art: programs. 

I like to think of it like a quilt. We each have something we want to add to it to make the blanket vibrate. Even when we feel like we are building something from scratch… we never really are. Someone gave us the blue prints… someone made the fabric… someone made the dye… and someone (and often more than one person) sewed it all nicely together. Coding is a beautiful world of its own. It feels like you are on a different planet when you are sharing, learning, and building with others.

If that's not the most beautiful thing.. I do not know what else is.
