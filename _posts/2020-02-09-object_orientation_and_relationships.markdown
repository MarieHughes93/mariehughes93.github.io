Honestly, when I started learning about object orientation.... I HATED it. I could not wrap my brain about what I was doing. Classes were confusing at first. I could not understand the idea of objects. It did not make sense to me. However, then I finally had my ah-ha moment.

To help maybe have someone else, I thought I would exlain how it finally clicked for me. 

When you think of a class think of it as a real life object. The method in which you are creating are things the class can do. For example we have a song class. The songs have an artist and a genre. The artist has many songs and genres. The genre has many songs and artist. When you start to think of them as real object it can change the process of working on multiple relationships and make it easier. You can't have a song without an artist. An artist cannot be an artist without songs... and gener is nothing without songs. By breaking it down and thinking it in real terms the way they connect will start to become more clear.
